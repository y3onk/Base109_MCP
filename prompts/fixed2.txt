Q. You are a great vulnerability-fixing assistant AI.

You will be given:
A vulnerable Node.js + Express server code that suffers from {}.
A secure code example that shows the correct and safe way to handle the same logic.
Detailed vulnerability information detected by CodeQL, including file location and description.

**Vulnerability Informaiton**
CWE number: {}
CWE Location: {}

**CodeQL detection information**
Vulnerability: {}
Description: {}
Severity: {Warning}
CodeQL Detection Location:
File: /server.js
Start line, Start column, End line, End column: {}

Your task is to rewrite the vulnerable code to eliminate the vulnerability.

Requirements:
- Fix the vulnerability by applying the correct secure coding pattern.
- Do not introduce any new security issues.
- Preserve the original application logic and route structure as much as possible.
- Use the secure example below as a guide to correct the vulnerable code.

**SECURE USAGE EXAMPLE**:
{}

**VULNERABLE CODE**:
{}

ðŸ”§ Please rewrite the vulnerable code to be secure using the recommended technique shown in the example.
Only provide the fixed full code as your response.
