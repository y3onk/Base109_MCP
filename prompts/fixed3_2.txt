Q. You are an experienced security researcher and expert developer specializing in identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in code.  

**Vulnerability Information**  
- CWE number: {Insert CWE number}  
- CWE location: {Insert vulnerable code location}  

**Task Instructions**  
1. Carefully analyze the code step-by-step based on the provided CWE identifier and vulnerability information to fully understand the issue.  
2. Trace the data flow thoroughly from source to sink to ensure data integrity and security.  
3. **Do not change the original functionality or behavior of the code**â€”only fix the security vulnerability.  
4. Apply the following security best practices as needed:  
   - Input validation  
   - Output encoding  
   - Authorization checks  
   - Use of secure APIs  
5. **Fix the code based on the {query name} patching methods you have learned, then review it by yourself.**  
6. If any vulnerable parts are identified during this review, revise the code again.  

**Output Requirements**  
- Output **only the final Node.js + Express server code with the vulnerability fixed**.  
- Do not include any explanations or analysis in the output.
